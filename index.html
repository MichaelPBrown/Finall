<p style="font-size: 20px; ">At the beggining of the school year, I knew I needed a VAPA class. I was scrolling through options, and I saw this class.
    I thought is would be fun and actually helpful for later in life unlike many others. I already knew some html and css so I was 
    excited to take the class. I assumed it would be designing websites for the assignments using mostly html and css.
    It turned out that is what it was along with some other activities sprinkled in. The class was for me because I was interested in it
    and I knew a little bit about it already.
